# Seeding Regulations

2. Warmups are allowed as long as each map is under 3 minutes.
3. Here is how protects, bans and picks will happen. The winner of the !roll will get first pick no matter what, and the winner of the !roll will elect if they want to protect or ban first.
4. Example: If Team 1 opts to protect first, Team 1 will ban second and Team 2 will protect second and ban first. If Team 1 opts to protect second, Team 1 will ban first and Team 2 will protect first and ban second.
