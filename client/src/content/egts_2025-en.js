# General Rules
- This tournament is a **1v1 double-elimination tournament.** 
- The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
- Any player who meets the requirements stated in the rank restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament will aim to get badged, some players might be declined by osu! staff following the screening phase.
- Only staff members who are **Commentators and/or Streamers** are allowed to partake in the tournament.
- Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
- All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
- Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Stage Regulations
- This tournament has eight rounds: the Qualifiers, the RO64, the RO32, the RO16, the Quarterfinals, the Semifinals, the Finals, and the Grand Finals.
- Players will be seeded in the bracket according to the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round.
- The winning condition for each round is listed below:
    - Round of 64: Best-Of-9 (First to 5 points)

    - *Note: for the Grand Finals match, the player that is coming from the Winner's bracket is required to win one "set", that is, one best of 13, to win the tournament. The player coming from the Loser's bracket, however, needs to win 2 sets.*
   
# Qualifiers Regulations
 - During this round, multiplayer lobbies will be opened at specific timeslots throughout the weekend.

 - A private match will be created and players will be invited into the lobby when the time comes. Make sure you're online at this time.
 - There are no warmups.
 - Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. Only a player's best run will be taken into account for the ranking.
 - Seeding will be made with the average rank of each player on each map. 
 - Only the 64 best players will continue on to the bracket stage.

# Mappool Instructions

- Every song used in the tournament is either used with the artist's permission, or is part of the [osu! Featured Artists listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists). 
- The Loser's Bracket matches will be played on the same mappool as the Winner's bracket matches of the same weekend.
- Each mappool consists of 6 brackets: **NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime, ForceMod, and Tiebreaker**. The Qualifiers pool does not have a Tiebreaker bracket.
- The mappool for the Qualifiers round will have 10 maps. The mappool for the Round of 64 will have 14 maps. The mappools from the Round of 32 until Quarterfinals will have 15 maps each. The mappools from Semifinals until Grand Finals will have 16 maps each.

- The Tiebreaker pool is played with Freemod enabled, but players are exempted from any mod requirement.
- The mappool for each round will be showcased a week before matches are to be played.

# Scheduling Instructions
- Every round will be held **during the weekend**. (It is however allowed to schedule to another day, if no good time is found during the weekend and a referee is available.)
- We will try to schedule accordingly to both players' timezones. The schedule will be released the previous weekend of each round.
- Reschedules will only be accepted if both players agree on a time: this needs to be done and notified to the tournament hosts before the **Thursday of the weekend the matches are to be played at 23:59 UTC**.

# Match Regulations
- A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both players will be invited into the room when it's match time. 
- If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
- If one of the players is late, the match can be postponed by 10 minutes at most.
- There is no penalty for not joining the room immediately on match time, as long as it's within the allowed postponed time.
- If neither of the players are in the lobby after 10 minutes, the highest seeded player will advance by default.
- The match will be played in Head-to-head, ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "EGTS 2025: (Player Red) vs (Player Blue)".
- There are no warm-ups.
- Each player will roll with the command "!roll" in the chat.
- The player with the **highest roll bans second and picks first**. The player with the **lowest roll bans first and picks second**.
- Each player has to ban **one beatmap** from the pool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any player in the entire match.
- Each player has 2 mins to announce their ban. If they didn't tell the referee by that time, the ban will be made with a !roll command.
- After the ban phase, players will take turns selecting beatmaps out of the map pool until a winner is decided.
- Players may pick freely from any bracket.
- Players will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a player didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a !roll command. If players do not get ready by the end of the timer, the match will be force-started, no matter what.
- If a player disconnects between beatmaps, the match can be delayed by 10 minutes at maximum. This delay can only be applied once.
- If a player disconnects after 30 seconds of play, they get treated as if they lost the map.
- If a player disconnects before 30 seconds of play, the point can be rematched. This is only allowed once per player.
- All maps are played with No Fail enforced. Failed players' scores do count in the case a player forgets to add it during cases such as ForceMod or TieBreaker maps. 
- If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. If it does end in a tie again, the map will be nullified again, and the player who picked it will have to pick another map.
- In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected.
- Where rules do not prevail, common sense shall.
